Dynamic Bioinformatics Programming Algorithm. Global alignments, which attempt to align every residue in every sequence, are most useful when the sequences in the query set are similar and of roughly equal size.

• Engineered a modern C implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm for global sequence alignment, emphasizing its applicability in aligning diverse genomic sequences.

• Successfully aligned the first 8 characters of the Human Genomic Sequence (Seq1) with a generic 7-character genomic sequence (Seq2), demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in accommodating variations in sequence lengths and identifying overall similarities.
